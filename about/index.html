    <h2>Ministry Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Pastor Micah Yohanna Sarki's journey into ministry began at a young age when he felt the calling of God upon his life. Born and raised in Nigeria, he witnessed firsthand the transformative power of the Gospel in his community and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing his theological education, Pastor Micah began serving in various capacities within the church. His passion for teaching and preaching quickly became evident as he demonstrated a unique ability to make complex biblical truths accessible to people from all walks of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout his ministry, Pastor Micah has been committed to three core principles: authentic biblical teaching, compassionate pastoral care, and practical application of God's word in daily life. These principles have guided his approach to ministry and have been instrumental in the growth and development of the congregations he has served.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Pastor Micah continues to serve with the same passion and dedication that marked the beginning of his ministry. Through his preaching, writing, and pastoral care, he remains committed to helping people discover and fulfill God's purpose for their lives.
